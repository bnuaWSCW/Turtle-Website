  <p class=intro>Chess' history started in northern India in the 6th century. After its origination, it spread towards Persia. After Peria, it was spread by the Muslims in Persia towards southern Europe</p>
  <p>
  <ul>Each Piece has originated from Persia or other countries and were later adopted and readjusted by Europe:</p>
    <br>
  <li>The Rook was originated from the Persian term Rukh - which means a chariot. Persian/indian chariets had large walled structures on them, like a fortification. This was the design of the rook</li>
    <br>
    <li>The chess piece "queen" originated from ther Persian game of shatranj. In that game, the queen also had great power.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The King originated in Chaturanga, in which the King was called a rajah. Later on when ther Persian took hold of the game, it was known as a shah(Persian term for king).</li>
    <br>
    <li>The term pawn originated in France as "paon." Paon is a medival latin term which means "foot soldier."</li>
    <br>
    <li>Not much information of Persian terms of the bishop, although the Bishop was introduced in the 12th century, way before the Persians took over the game.The bishop was introduced in Europe. It was given its name as bishops served severally within armies.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The knight originated from India as the game was introduced. Within Persian origins, the knight was called an asp and the Arabs called it a faras. As and faras are both terms for a horse. As chess served accross Europe, the game of Chess became more of a royal court than a battlefield, than renamed the horse as a knight. This is also why the knight has a knight symbol.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class=paragraph>As said throughout the origins of the knight, the sport chess was a game representing war and conflict. As chess was going throughout Europe, it turned into court justice and royal entities rather than a march towards either victory or defeat.</p>
