  <p class=intro>The rook is a chess piece located in the corners of the board. Each player has 2 on their side. Rooks are typically strong pieces in which was placed in the corners.</p>
  <p class=paragraph>The rook can only go forward and backward as much as it wants. As per all pieces, if an ally piece is obstructing their way, the rook cannot progress further. On the contrary, if an enemy piece is obstrusting the rooks' way, the rock cannot progress further than that point, but is allowed to capture the piece. 
  <br>
  <br>
  If the king is in check, you cannot move your rook unless for blocking the check, taking the aggressor, or using a move called a castle.</p>
  <h2 class=subheading>Castle</h2>
    <p class=paragraph>Within chess, their is an act where a king can move two squares by castling. The only way this works is the rook trades places with the king. The king moves two spaces either left or right, and the rook jumps over and sits either left or right of the king.The rules of castling follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If any chess piece at all is obstructing the castle, it is illegal</li>
      <br>
      <li>If the king is in check, you may use a castle.</li>
      <br>
      <li>If having the intention to castle, but there is a chess pieces' line of sight obstructing the castle, it is illegal to caslte. This means if there is a potential move that could check the king by castling, then it is illegal.</li>
      <br>
      <li>If king has already moved, it cannot castle.</li>
      <br>
      <li>If the rook has already move, it cannot castle, although if another rook that has not moved and is able to castle, that is legal.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class=paragraph>Ultimately, caslting is a great move that brings your king into safety while also getting your rook into battle.</p>
