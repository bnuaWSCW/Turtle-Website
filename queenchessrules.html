    <p class=intro>The queen is the best piece on the board. Each player has one queen on either side of the board and is placed in the middle. The pawn once reaching the end is able to transform into the queen, or others.</p>
    <p class=paragraph>The queens moveset is the combined moves of the rook and bishop. The queen can go wherever diagonally, horizonally or vertically within a line. If a chess piece is obstructing the line of sight for the queen, it cannot go further than that piece. If it is an ally, it if obviously illegal to tkae your own piece. If it is an enemy, you are able to capture the piece.</p>
    <p class=paragraph>The queen is the most important piece on the board aside from the king. But it is most useless. Its reason is because of its dominance. Some players may be scared to use the queen as it is a such an important piece, and forget the piece entirely. A tip, is to use the queen not too early, but not too late. Develop all the pieces first, than see what to do with the queen. </p>
