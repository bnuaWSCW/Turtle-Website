  <p class=paragraph>The pawn is the most common and weak piece in on the board. With 8 pawns on each side, they are almost always the first piece on the board to move.</p>
  <p class=paragraph> The moveset of the pawn includes: going forward and left or right. Pawns will never go backwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  If there is nothing obstructing it at all, it will only go straight. Although if there is a piece one square up and one square to the side, the pawn is allowed to take it.
  <br>
  <br>
  If a pawn reaches to the other side of the board without getting capture, it is allowed to change into 1 of the 4 pieces of choice: Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight</p>
  <p class=paragraph>Pawns are generally looked down upon, as it has the weakest move set of all the pieces(aside from the king). But a pawn getting turned into a better piece is the reason for why keeping pawns until the end-game, where there isn't much pieces on the board, is helpful to win. Becuase they are able to turn into the best piece and create territory.</p>
