  <p class=paragraph>The king is as it entails - it is the king. In chess, if the king is immobilized and cannot esacpe from the enemy attacking them, they lose.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the king is the most important piece, the king cannot do much in the board. The king can only go one square either: diagonal, forward, backward or sideways.
  <br>
  If the king gets captured, then the player loses. This means also if a space that a player can capture is of the kings radius, the king cannot go there(because the player would lose). This also means such move is illegal.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the king is in a piece(s) radius, and can escape, this is called a check. A check mean that the king is about to be captured and you need to escape the check. To get out of a check, you are able to move your king. If the piece that is enabling the check can get captured, you are allowed to use a piece to capture it. You cannot move any other piece when you are in check. You can only move the king to safety or another piece that is able to block the check or capture the piece that is checking.</p>
