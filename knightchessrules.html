    <p class=intro>The knight is a great piece for the early game, as this is one of 2 pieces that you can use on your first move. This is because knights are able to skip over all pieces.This piece is one of the four pieces a pawn can turn into if reached the end of the board.</p>
    <p class=paragraph>The knight once again can skip through obstructing pieces. This is because of the knights' moveset. The knight will always move like an "L" shape(ex. move two squares and one square to the left or right - creating an L shape). What is unique about this piece is that it is the only piece that can skip squares as a moveset. Like a bishop, you can skip squares, but you don't have certain squares in that diagonal line that you can't move to. The knight is the only piece that cannot move one square. It makes up for its L shape by confusing players and winning material.</p>
