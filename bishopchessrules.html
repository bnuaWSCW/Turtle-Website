  <p class="intro">The bishop is a piece that is vital towards the end-game of chess. Bishop is usually a spiritual religious leader to presides over a meeting. This is convenient as bishops are next to the king and queen.</p>
  <p class=paragraph>Within chess, each player has 2 bishops on their side. The bishops' legal moves are to move diagonally. If an ally is obstructing the way, the bishop cannot move further(go through the piece). If an enemy is obstructing the way, the bishop is allow to capture the piece.

  The pawn when reached the end of the opposing side, can turn into a bishop or another piece.</p>
